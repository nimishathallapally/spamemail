nltk:
python programming environment. It includes language processing libraries for 
tokenization, parsing, classification, stemming, labeling, and semantic reasoning

    Featutes:
    1.Morphological processing: Breaking down linguistic input into smaller tokens, such as splitting the term "daily" into sub-word tokens like "day" and "ly."
    2.Syntax Analysis: Syntax analysis in NLP checks if a phrase is grammatically correct and organizes it into a structure that shows the grammatical relationships
    3.Semantic Analysis: Assesses the meaning of text by determining its specific interpretation, such as ignoring nonsensical phrases
    4.Pragmatic Analysis:  resolving ambiguities such as whether "Put the fruits in the basket on the table" means placing fruits in a basket that is on the table or placing the basket on the table.

from nltk.corpus import stopwords

In NLP, stopwords (common words like "the", "a", "an", "in") are often filtered out to enhance text analysis and computational 
efficiency by focusing on more important content words.

from nltk.stem.porter import PorterStemmer

Stemming is the process of reducing words to their root form, such as converting 
"chocolates," "chocolatey," and "choco" to "chocolate" and "retrieval," "retrieved," "retrieves" to "retrieve."
