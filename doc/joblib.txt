Joblib module in Python is especially used to execute tasks parallelly using Pipelines rather than executing them 
sequentially one after another. Joblib module lets the user use the full potential of their devices by utilizing 
all the cores present in their device to make the process as fast as possible.


The joblib.dump function is used to serialize Python objects and save them to a file. This is particularly 
useful for saving machine learning models and other large data objects that you want to reuse later without having 
to recompute them.
